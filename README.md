# memory_repo
this is going to be my own personal diary of sorts - i might reflect a little bit on my day, or i might archive small independent bits of coding practice i do 'for funsies' here. my anjunabeats data project has been left on the back burner due to having tons of other nigh-unmanageable work, but i want to ~~git~~ push myself to contribute to my personal space on github a little more consistently, and i thought a digital journal would be the way to do it. every memory will be a new commit (or a few commits) and i will probably hate myself for it, but maybe i'll get a little more used to using the command line. ~~i might 'bash' my head in~~

the name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to something from a game - if you know, you know

[10/12/2024] i might do some moving around of projects; there are some things that seem to be mutating into their own thing that shouldn't belong here anymore.
