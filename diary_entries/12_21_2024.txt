I'm back, baby. 

My winter break just started, so I will dedicate some of my time to coding projects that are two-thirds recreational and two-thirds practise-
I know that adds up to over one hundred percent, but part of the 'recreation' does come from the joy and satisfaction of knowing you've retained things you've learned. 

I hope to see speedy improvement in my ability to summon information from my mind - I don't think it helps me to be so dependent on StackOverflow and ChatGPT all the time. 

I'm supposed to be the one in control of these machines, after all.
