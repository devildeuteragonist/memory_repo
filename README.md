# memory_repo
this is going to be my own personal diary of sorts - i might reflect a little bit on my day, or i might archive small independent bits of coding practice i do 'for funsies' here. my anjunabeats data project has been left on the back burner due to having tons of other nigh-unmanageable work, but i want to ~~git~~ push myself to contribute to my personal space on github a little more consistently, and i thought a digital journal would be the way to do it. every memory will be a new commit (or a few commits) and i will probably hate myself for it, but maybe i'll get a little more used to using the command line. ~~i might 'bash' my head in~~

the name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to something from a game - if you know, you know

**NOTE**: some smaller pieces of practice intended to log progress may evolve into their own projects. in such a case, they will be moved to a new repository made especially for them. 

**another note**: as of 12/23/2024, projects that evolve and are in turn copied into new repositories will have their original versions archived here. i will continue making progress on them in the repos made for them. projects moved before this date are NOT archived here because i didn't have the foresight to know that i'd like to keep their baby versions as i learned how to befriend this 'puter.
