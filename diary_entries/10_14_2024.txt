it's been a while since i actually wrote a diary entry, huh? 

you know, the glitz and glamour of creating plain text files in bash has sort of faded to me.
it no longer feels challenging and exciting to do it. that's why i guess i fell off on this. 

that's not to say it still isn't a little bit fun; it's just lost its magic. 
i guess that's a testament to my increasing proficiency in bash.
