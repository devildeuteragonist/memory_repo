trying not to implode with finals and projects. i've completed a semester in my data science major now.
i've learned a lot, and it's helped remove the spell of the dunning-krueger effect, hehe
might've mentioned before, but i'm learning very quickly, and the projects that i am doing in class are increasing in complexity;
therefore, much of the practice that i did at the beginning of this repository's life now feels like it'd be far too easy - 
like come on...i'm way past seeing pushing text files to my repository as challenging.

the memory repository will probably be dramatically overhauled when i'm able to go on december break; 
i feel more confident to turn some of my ideas here into fully-fleshed projects. 
additionally, i feel like i now have a better grasp on how repositories are actually used. 

i see myself using this space enough that i might begin using my local terminal instead of that in codespaces;
it is simply more comfortable for me.
